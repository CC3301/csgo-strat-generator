# csgo-strat-generator

**This script is going to fuck up you csgo game if you can't take it as fun.**


## Usage

  - Run the script. You need to have perl installed to do so.
    It will then generate relatively boring output. Try adding 
    a number as an argument and see how the output changes.

## Difficulty
  
  - Difficulty is used to describe how much factors will be changed by this script.
    For example: Passing no difficulty to the script, it will default to difficulty
    0 which is just going to decide what weapon and pistol you are allowed to use.

  - Difficulty can not only affect the amount of properties changed, but can also
    take influence on these properties themselves. Setting a absurdly high difficulty
    will result in some properties being changed more or to harder levels than others.

## WIP
  
  - Hardcore mode
  - Strats

**Have fun and remember to *NOT* overwrite your main config.**
