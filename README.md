# csgo-strat-generator

**This script is going to fuck up you csgo game if you can't take it as fun.**


## Usage

  - Run the script. You need to have perl installed to do so.
    It will then generate relatively boring output. Try adding 
    a number as an argument and see how the output changes.

  - For extra help run the script with the 'help' argument.

## Difficulty
  
  - Difficulty is used to describe how much factors will be changed by this script.
    For example: Passing no difficulty to the script, it will default to difficulty
    0 which is just going to decide what weapon and pistol you are allowed to use.

  - Difficulty can not only affect the amount of properties changed, but can also
    take influence on these properties themselves. Setting a absurdly high difficulty
    will result in some properties being changed more or to harder levels than others.

  - Difficulty technically has no fixed limit, however you will get an error when trying
    to use a difficulty higher than 2 times the amout of strats in your data/strats.inv 
    file. 

## WIP
  
  - More strats and hardcore settings. 
  - Strats system
  - Hardcore system (currently disabled)

## Planned

  - Make adding more strats or weapons, which might
    be added in future csgo updates, to the '.inv'
    files easier.

**Have fun and remember to *NOT* overwrite your main config.**
