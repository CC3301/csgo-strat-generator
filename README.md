# csgo-strat-generator

**This script is going to fuck up you csgo game if you can't take it as fun.**

This is written in Perl and should work corss-platform, since it
doesn't use any external modules.

## Usage:
- If you are on Linux: 
  use the perl-packager version by just running
    *"./csgo-strat-gen"*
  from the command line. You might have to make
  it executable tho.
  
- If you are on Linux 2.0:
  use perl itself, make the .pl file excutable
  and run it like this
    *"./csgo-strat-gen.pl"*
    
- If you are on Windows:
  Run it with the perl interpreter like this
    *"perl csgo-strat-gen.pl"*.
  Everything else is untested.
  
  
## Difficulty:
  There are difficulty levels 1..5, however there is no
  upper limit. 
  
  Until the 'highest' difficulty there are new options 
  being added which each stage, everything bigger than 5
  just fucks with some of the probability parameters. 
  As i said there is no upper limit, go for a thousand if 
  you can turn your mouse down to 1 DPI.
  
  
  
  
**Have fun and remember to *NOT* overwrite your main config.**
