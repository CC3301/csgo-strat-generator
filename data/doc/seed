Presenting the seed-system:

  Seeds are strings of data, exported by the program when the '--export' flag is set. Seeds
  can be shared accross computers and platforms, meaning no more hassle for you to copy
  the buy string to your friends, while you can just use the '--write-csgo' feature. No more
  sharing of screenshots for strats is required. The exported seed can be imported to another
  instance of this program and will produce the same output as in the instance it was exported
  from. 

  Some technical information about seeds:

    Seeds are base64 encoded strings of data in a certain format. The seed can be imported/exported
    stored and imported at any time. (Due to future technical changes, seeds might only work in 
    supported versions, since the feature will change over time.) The data format in which the seed is
    before encoding and after decoding, is defined as follows:

    p:p2000,w:ak47,

    This is a simple key value format and should be really easy to use and understand.


  How to use seeds:

    Export:
      Run the csgo-strat-generator with the flag '--export' to generate a seed form the generated
      game-rule set.

    Import: 
      Run the csgo-strat-generator with the flag '--import <seed>' to generate a game-rule set
      according to what the output was.



  Known/Expected issues:

    There is a chance that the config between the users differ. Which might result in items/settings
    not being displayed even though they were originally generated.

    When there is a p2000/USP-S/Glock as pistol setting, there is a chance that the outputs differ,
    because the buy-slug for each of those is "NULL" since there is no point in buying a glock/USP-S/
    P2000. This might result in different ouput than originally generated.
