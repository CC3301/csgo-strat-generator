Documentation file for the seed system.

  Description:

    A seed is a string of data that can be retrieved by supplying the '--export' flag on the command
    line or setting 'export_seed' to 1 in the config. Check the config documentation if you whish to 
    know how to do that. This exported seed can be imported into the program buy supplying the
    '--import' flag followed by a space and the seed. Note that you should qoute the seed with 
    single qoutes to avoid your shell (bash/zsh/sh/etc..) from trying to read that string.



  How seeds work internally:

    The seed is effectively a semi-random string of numbers, letters (upper and lower case) and special
    characters.
    Upon closer inspection, you might notice that, although the seed might look completely different,
    the numbers will always stay the same and - most importantly - they stay at the same spot in the seed.
    When importing a seed, another output seed is generated. It does differ but only in the random parts.
    The numbers stay, as previously mentioned, the same. 

    These numbers are the item id's. Wether the number is the pistol id or something else, is defined
    by its position inside the seed. The first index, aka the first number represents the difficulty.
    If two non-numeric characters follow after each other, the "invisble" index between these characters
    is automatically set to 0. The seed lenght can vary, depending on the difficulty that is set. 
    However, due to the item-generation algorithm, we need to fill the "rest" of the values in the internal
    seed data storage up with 0's. Otherwise the item generation is going to fail.



  Intention:

    Seeds are intended to easily share game-rule sets with your friends. Who can then import the seed to 
    their own instance of this program, which allows them to use other features such as the '--write-csgo'
    option.
