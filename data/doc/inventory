General structure of inventory files

  Inventory files are read line by line by the inventory file reader. The data gets then passed
  to certain prasers, which process the data for each different inventory type. For example,
  the pistol, weapon, util and grenade inventory files are each parsed the same. Here's an 
  example on how these files are structured:

  Item Name    :          buy_type      ,         ct_price         -         t_price
      ^        ^             ^          ^            ^             ^           ^
      |        |             |          |            |             |           |
   Name of   seperated    this tells  seperated   The price      seperated  The price 
   the item  by a colon   csgo what   by a comma  of this item   by a dash  of this item
                          to buy                  on CT side                on T side

  So a complete, valid line in one of the forementioned files would look like this:

    Item Name:item,1000-1200




  Now when it comes to parsing the strat inventory files, there are some differences to the item
  inventory parsing. 

  Strat Name   :        strat description         ;            strat description.2   ,         strat_score
       ^       ^             ^                    ^                 ^                ^            ^
       |       |             |                    |                 |                |            |
  Name of    seperated   Explains the strat  Create a newline  this will be in a   seperated   score of the 
  the Strat  by a colon  in more detail      in the output     new line            by a comma  strat

  So a complete, valid line the strat inventory file would look either like this:

    Strat Name:strat_description,strat_score

  or like this:

    Strat Name:strat_description;strat_description_line_2,strat_score




  The hardcore inventory is currently disabled. You can force the usage with --force-hardcore. However,
  there is no documentation and the feature is there, but doesnt really work together with other parts
  of the program.

  
  When these requirements are not met, the program will throw a 'malformed inventory file' error.
