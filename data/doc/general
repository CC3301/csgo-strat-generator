  Description:

    This file provides general information about this program


  Intention:

    This program was written with the intention to make Your average csgo game
    a bit more interesting and difficult. The inentetion is NOT consisting of:

      - The idea of ruining peoples games, they choose to use this program and 
        apply its output

      - The idea of ruining games for people other than this programs users, 
        should there be harm or negative influence in any kind and form present,
        this was not the intention. It is 100% the users choice to apply to 
        those settings and the user himself has to deal with hate in any shape
        or form which the user might be getting.

      - The idea of deciding between loss and win. Logically it might appear 
        easier to win or loose depending on the game-rule set. Sure this 
        program can make your csgo game hell, but this was not the intetion
        the users is entirely self responsive for any kind of rage or 
        hardware damage which might be caused by this game.
