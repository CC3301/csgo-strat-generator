Documentation about the documentation. Hell yeah, recursion!

  Description: 

    Documentation is used to assist the user in using the software it was provided with.



  How documentation works internally:

    If, anywhere on the command line, a '--doc' flag is detected, normal operation will
    be ignored and only the documentation part will be executed. The documentation files are
    located in the 'data' folder in the 'doc' subdirectory. These files are read line by 
    line and are then printed to the terminal, without any checks or parsing.



  Intention:

    Provide a piece of information that the user can use not much different than actually using the 
    program itself. Help the user understand how this program works and encourage self-development.



  Syntax:

    Honestly, just look at the oder documentation files and try to copy the format in which those are written.
    As mentioned above these files do not go through any sort of parsing or integrity checks.
