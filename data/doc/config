Documentation for the config system.

  Description:

    The config file, located inside the data folder, is used to customize the behaviour of this 
    program permanently. Below is a list of config keys which can be used. You might find that
    a lot of the config keys can also be used as command line arguments and vice versa. This is not
    true. Every config key can also be specified as command line argument, but not every command line
    argument can be written in the form of a config key.



  How the config works internally:

    The config file is read by the parser after setting the hard coded default values, thus overwriting
    these default settings. After reading the config file, the parser continues to read the command line
    arguments, which in turn overwrite anything set in the config. Only certian config keys are allowed,
    a list of which is supplied below. These config settings are then stored in the same states-table
    as all other settings, making it easy to add new options and remove old ones.



  Intention:

    The config is intended to persistantly hold user specific settings. This allows the user to
    set own options, i.e. the user might not want to have pistols generated, therefore he can set
    the 'disable.pistol' key in the config. This setting is saved until he edits the config file again.
    This prevents the user form having to specifty the '--disable-pistol' flag everytime the user 
    wants to run this program.
  


  Syntax:

      The config file syntax is pretty simple:

        key:value



  List of config keys:

    This is a list of all config keys, along side with what values can be assigned to them.

    'difficulty'        |  Accepts any integer, except negative ones 
    'default_key'       |  Accepts any type of alpha-numeric character(s)
    'disable.pistol'    |  Accpets a boolean-type value, either 1 or 0
    'disable.weapon'    |  Accpets a boolean-type value, either 1 or 0
    'disable.grenades'  |  Accpets a boolean-type value, either 1 or 0
    'disable.utils'     |  Accpets a boolean-type value, either 1 or 0
    'disable.hardcore'  |  Accpets a boolean-type value, either 1 or 0
    'disable.strats'    |  Accpets a boolean-type value, either 1 or 0
    'display_disabled'  |  Accepts a boolean-type vlaue, either 1 or 0
    'write_csgo'        |  Accepts a boolean-type vlaue, either 1 or 0
    'write_file'        |  Accepts a boolean-type vlaue, either 1 or 0
    'export_seed'       |  Accepts a boolean-type vlaue, either 1 or 0

    
    This is a list of all config keys, along side with what settings they actually change.
    
    'difficulty'        |  Sets the difficulty the program will run with  
    'default_key'       |  Sets the default key used in the buy command
    'disable.pistol'    |  Disables pistol generation
    'disable.weapon'    |  Disables weapon generation
    'disable.grenades'  |  Disables grenade generation  
    'disable.utils'     |  Disables utility generation
    'disable.hardcore'  |  Disables hardcore setting generation
    'disable.strats'    |  Disables strat generation
    'display_disabled'  |  Show disabled settings in the output, even if they would otherwise be hidden 
    'write_csgo'        |  Write a config file with the buy command to the csgo config folder (Windows only)
    'write_file'        |  Write the output generated into a text file
    'export_seed'       |  Print the seed on output
