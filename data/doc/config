Information about the csgo-strat gen config file

  Basically, every option you can set with the command line arguments can also be set
  in the config. There is a certain hierarchy to this concept:
  
  - Default is set in the source code
  - Config overwrites Default
  - Command line options overwrite Config

  
  To use this function, create a file called 'config' inside the data folder. The
  following list of config keys can be set, grouped by the type of setting you 
  can add to them.

  Integer:
    - difficulty

  String:
    - default_key

  Boolean:
    - disable.pistol
    - disable.weapon
    - disable.grenades
    - disable.utils
    - disable.hardcore
    - disable.strats
    - display_disabled
    - write_output
    - write_csgo

  

  When it comes to the config file syntax, you might wonder why things look like 
  they look. Basically its a key-value storage. Internally some settings are grouped.
  This is where the '.' comes into play. It seperates the setting group by the setting
  itself. So in the case of 'disable.pistol', 'disable' is the setting group and
  'pistol' is the setting name. Followed by a colon comes the value. Here are some
  examples:

    - disable.pistol:1
    - default_key:c
    - difficulty:10

  If there is a different type of value there, which is not of the expected type,
  the script will die. Usually you get a pretty good representation of where the
  error is in the config file.
