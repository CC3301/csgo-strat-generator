Documentation for the debug mode

  Description:

    The debug mode is used to find errors, what might be going wrong and just general 
    troubleshooting. The debug mode is enabled by using '--debug' on the command line.



  How debug mode works internally:

    All debug messages are written (with timestamp and module name) to a log file, which is located in
    'log/latest.log'. The debug mode also tries to load the perl module 'Carp::Always', which allowes
    for stack traces on program crashes. 



  Intention:

    For development purposes only, proving in-depth information about what is going on under the hood
    of this software.
